# Afterword
Back to earlier 2011 in CUMT, linux adventures were still suffering from the unstable linkage client. It urged me to study the 802.1x protocol family and finally found more hidden details in the customized linkage protocol. Two months later, the network sponsor changed and it ended.

This project was remarkable, for it was the first application I distributed for download. To provide completely network-free library dependency, the whole qt library were rebuilt over night. 

In memory of the days when programming was for fun instead of money

In memory of the days walking by the Mirror Lake in hot summer night

In memory of youth that never lost, for youth is always measured by mind instead of body

Now I'm back again - I'm loyal to myself and my users.
